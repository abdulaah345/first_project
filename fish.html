      <p class="ho-tap"> One of the most important aspects of caring for a fish is ensuring it has sufficient space.
        According to the experts at Fishkeeping World, bigger is better when it comes to fish tanks. A large aquarium
        not only ensures your fish has ample room to swim,<span class="area1"> explore and grow, but it is also easier
          for you to maintain</span>. Keeping the temperature and pH balanced is easier with a large tank than with a
        small one.
        However, a larger tank also requires a bigger investment up front as well as higher maintenance costs. We
        recommend researching the minimum tank requirements for your chosen fish species and then investing in the
        largest tank you can afford. </p>

      <p class="tap"> t’s important to learn your fish’s dietary requirements. Some fish may need live food, such as
        shrimp or worms, while others prefer algae or are just fine with generic fish flakes.
        <span class="area2">Once you determine your fish’s ideal diet</span>, make sure you don’t overfeed him. Just as
        with any other animal (or human), overeating can have negative effects on your fish’s health. Speak to your
        veterinarian to learn just how much and how often to feed your pet fish.

      <p class="h-tap"> Keeping your fish tank clean is a crucial part of caring for a fish. Nobody likes to live in a
        dirty home — not even fish! A dirty tank is ugly to look at and can also be dangerous for your fish.<span
          class="area3"> Your cleaning methods will vary depending on the type of fish tank you are using and the items
          you place inside</span>. You may be able to use automated cleaning scrubbers or even snails to help maintain
        your aquarium, but you will still need to change the water and filters on a regular basis. On top of cleaning
        the tank itself, you must also clean the tank’s substrate and decorations. </p>

      <p class="t-tap"> Part of the fun of owning a fish is creating a visually appealing aquarium. While it’s certainly
        fun to decorate your fish’s home, it also helps improve your fish’s quality of life.<span class="area4"> Fish
          love to have plants and objects to hide behind and swim through.
          As you choose items for your fish tank</span> , don’t forget to make sure they are compatible with your fish.
        Everything from the substrate you choose to line the bottom of the tank to the plants and additional decorations
        can have positive or negative impacts on your fish. </p>
