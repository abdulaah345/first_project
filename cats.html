      <p class="ho-tap"> If you have a new cat, or have moved to a new home, it is important not to let your cat out
        until they have adjusted to their new environment. <span class="area1">This gives them a chance to spread their
          scent and find their own way home</span>, and usually takes three to four weeks.
        When you let your cat out for the first time, let them out before meal time – that way, they’re more likely to
        want to return to eat. </p>

      <p class="tap"> Five important things </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Cats must eat meat. They are 'obligate carnivores' which means cats cannot be vegetarian</li>
        <li>Choose a cat food that is complete rather than complementary so that your pet gets a complete, balanced
          diet.</li>
        <li>Cats like to eat away from other cats</li>
        <li>Keep food, water and litter trays in different places so your cat knows that their food and water are clean.
        </li>
        <li>Your cat needs fresh water, which should be changed daily </li>

      <p class="h-tap"> You'll need to make sure your cat is neutered and microchipped as well as vaccinated, treated
        against parasites and regularly seen by a vet.
        <span class="area2">Vaccinations are available against a range of infections and cats should receive regular
          booster</span> vaccinations throughout their life to maintain their protection.
        Aside from veterinary care, you'll also want to make sure your cat is groomed and checked for dental disease as
        well as being fed a healthy diet.

    <div class="toys">
      <h1 class="t-ta"> to<span class="y">y</span>s </h1>
      <p class="t-tap"> Cats have super sensitive hearing, meaning they hear things humans do but a lot louder. In fact,
        they have one of the widest ranges of hearing in mammals. <span class="area3">It’s why your cat might notice an
          arrival at the door before you do</span>, or pick up on another cat’s presence in the neighbourhood.
        For cats, bonfire night is not only a noisy and unwelcome celebration – it is a highly unpredictable time. As
        creatures of habit, loud bangs and flashes of light take them by surprise, which makes them fearful. </p>
